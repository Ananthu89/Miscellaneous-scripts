I created these Python scripts for completing online course certifications. 

1. Four of them starting with the title "DL_Keras_Assignment" are related assignments on deep learning for the course titled "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras". 

2. One of the scripts is on using different ML techniques for classification tasks, with the relevant course name being used as the title. 

3. The last one, as the name suggests, is on applying survival analysis on cancer data for the course "Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis". This is a Markdown file I created as the final project. It contains visuals and discussion on the data, results, and future directions.
