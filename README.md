I created these Python scripts for completing online course certifications. 

Four of them starting with the title "Assignment" are related ones on deep learning for the course titled "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras". 
Another one, as the name suggests, is on applying survival analysis on cancer data for the course "Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis". This is a Markdown file I created as the final project and contains visuals and discussion regarding the data as well as each step.   

The final script is on using different ML techniques for classification tasks, with the relevant course name being used as the title.
