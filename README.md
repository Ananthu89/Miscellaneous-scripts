I created these Python projects for completing online course certifications. As the name suggests, one is on applying survival analysis on cancer data for the course "Specialized Models: Time Series and Survival Analysis". This is a Markdown file I created as the final project. It contains visuals and discussion on the data, results, and future directions.   

There is also a subfolder with assignements. 

1. Four of the scripts inside starting with the title "DL_Keras_Assignment" are related assignments on deep learning for the course titled "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras". 

2. There is also one on using different ML techniques for classification tasks, with the relevant course name being used as the title.
