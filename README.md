I created these Python scripts for completing online course certifications. Four of them starting with the title "Assignment" are related ones on deep learning for the course titled "Introduction to Deep Learning & Neural Networks with Keras". Another one, as the name suggests, is on applying survival analysis on cancer data. And the final one is on using different ML techniques for classification tasks.
